# EEGMMSL
Efficient Extended-Graph Multi-Matrices Subspace Learning: Toward Meta-Similarity and Efficiency Promotion

# Requirments
Matlab

# Datasets
Divide the datasets into five-fold cross-validated patterns like the example and place them in datasets_UCI folders.
The algorithm will select the training sets and test sets by the divided data automatically and conduct the five-fold cross-validation.
