# EEGMMSL
Efficient Extended-Graph Multi-Matrices Subspace Learning: Toward Meta-Similarity and Efficiency Promotion

# Requirments
Matlab

# Pre-steps of the Datasets
Divide the datasets into five-fold cross-validated patterns like the example and place them in datasets_UCI folders. 
The algorithm will select the training sets and test sets by the divided data automatically and conduct the five-fold cross-validation.

# About the Hyperparameters
It has 4 hyperparameters need to tune in the training. In the test, it is tuning-free. We have put the hyperparameters in the code and just give a range of each hyperparameters, and it will tune it automatically.
